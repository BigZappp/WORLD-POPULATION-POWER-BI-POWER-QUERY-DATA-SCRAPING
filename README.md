# World Population Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains interactive visualizations and analyses of the global population data. Using Power BI, this project explores trends in population distribution, growth, migration, and demographic characteristics across continents and countries.

## Overview
The dashboards highlight key statistics about the world's population, offering insights into yearly growth, median age, density, and net migration. This analysis serves as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and analysts seeking to understand global demographic patterns.

## Key Insights

#### Total Population:

The world population is approximately 8 billion.
The median age globally is 31.17 years.

#### Population by Continent:

Asia leads in population size, followed by Africa and Europe.
Median age varies significantly, with Europe having the highest median age (42.18 years) and Africa the lowest (20.35 years).

#### Population Density:

Monaco, Singapore, and Hong Kong have the highest population densities globally.
Countries like Bangladesh and Taiwan also report high population densities, exceeding 1,000 people per kmÂ².

#### Net Migration and Population Change:

Africa and Asia experience the highest population growth, with net increases of 33M and 30M annually.
Europe has a negative net migration of 1.5M, indicating population decline through migration.

#### Country-Level Population:

India, China, and the United States lead in population size, with India expected to surpass China soon.
Emerging economies like Indonesia, Pakistan, and Nigeria are also key contributors to global population growth.

## Dashboards
The repository includes the following dashboards:

#### Population Distribution:
